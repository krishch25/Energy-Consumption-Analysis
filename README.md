## üéØ Project Overview

As smart grids become more prevalent, accurately forecasting energy demand and understanding consumption patterns are critical for balancing supply and demand. This project tackles this challenge by applying a multi-faceted machine learning approach to a high-frequency dataset of household energy consumption and weather data. The core objectives are to forecast energy usage, segment consumers based on behavior, and identify inefficient consumption patterns.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Time-Series Forecasting**: Implemented **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX** models to predict future energy consumption, incorporating weather data (temperature, humidity) as exogenous variables to improve accuracy and interpretability.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Used **K-Means Clustering** to segment households into distinct groups based on their daily energy usage patterns, providing insights for targeted energy-saving campaigns.
- **Efficiency Classification**: Developed a **Random Forest Classifier** to distinguish between efficient and inefficient energy consumption, achieving an accuracy of **95.33%**.
- **In-Depth EDA**: Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis, including correlation analysis and feature engineering, to prepare the data for modeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a structured workflow, from data ingestion to model deployment and evaluation.

![Workflow Diagram](images/workflow.png) 

1.  **Data Collection**: Utilized a dataset containing minute-level smart meter readings and corresponding weather data.
2.  **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, normalized numerical features using `MinMaxScaler`, and one-hot encoded categorical features.
3.  **Feature Engineering**: Combined related features (e.g., multiple furnace/kitchen readings) and dropped redundant or highly correlated columns.
4.  **Modeling**:
    -   **Forecasting**: Trained ARIMA and SARIMAX models on daily resampled data.
    -   **Clustering**: Applied K-Means to identify 3 distinct consumption clusters.
    -   **Classification**: Trained a Random Forest model to classify usage efficiency.
5.  **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like **RMSE**, **MAPE**, and **Accuracy**.

## üìä Results & Visualizations

The models provided significant insights into energy consumption patterns.

### Time-Series Forecast (SARIMAX)
The SARIMAX model, which included weather variables, successfully captured the trends and seasonality in the energy data.

![SARIMAX Forecast](images/sarimax_forecast.png) 
- **ARIMA RMSE**: 273.41 kW
- **SARIMAX RMSE**: 294.79 kW
- While SARIMAX had a slightly higher RMSE, its ability to incorporate external factors makes it more robust and interpretable.

### Energy Consumption Clustering (K-Means)
K-Means successfully segmented users into three distinct clusters (Low, Medium, High consumption), enabling targeted demand-side management.

### Efficiency Classification (Random Forest)
The classifier demonstrated high performance in identifying inefficient usage patterns.
- **Accuracy**: 95.33%
- **Confusion Matrix**:
